# Grampian COVID-19 modelling

The pandemic has forced rapid changes across the NHS to care for COVID-19 patients. The NHS must now balance the needs of COVID-19 patients with the care it has always provided.

The aim of this project is to develop tools for supporting care planning in NHS Grampian during the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery period. To do this we will bring together a wide range of Grampian care data. We will then take an established model of COVID-19 spread and customise it for Grampian, using up-to-date local data. We will use this new local model to make short-term and longer-term predictions of what care patients in Grampian will need.

These tools will allow NHS Grampian to see how the COVID-19 outbreak develops, and respond to changes as quickly as possible to ensure there are beds, staff, and equipment where they are needed for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients.

This project is a collaboration between the Aberdeen Centre for Health Data Science and the NHS Grampian Health Intelligence team.
